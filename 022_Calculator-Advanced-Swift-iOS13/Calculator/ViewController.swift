/*
 keyword private (put in front of the property or method)
 to make our code a little bit more secure and less prone to unexpected errors
 This private property or method can be accessible only inside the current class(parent block).
 
 Swift Access Levels (like the clearance level)
 most restrictive <------------> least restrictive access level
 1. privete: only accessible in between the curly braces of that block of code
 2. fileprvate: only accessible inside the file that it was declared
 3. internal: accessible anywhere inside your current app module(default level)
 4. public: access is granted to other modules (e.g. frameworks, APIs, SDKs, libraries you want other modules to be able to tap into and use)
 5. open: Everything can be accessed by other modules. PLUS, classes and functions can be subclassed and overridden.

 Advantage:
 You can't accidentally modify something that is not meant to be modified by a different class or from a different place.
 
 To prevent that and to make your code safer, try to use access levels by starting out with private for all of your vars and lets, and methods, and leveling it up only when it's necessary.
