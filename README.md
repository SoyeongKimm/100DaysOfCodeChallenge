# 100DaysOfCode Challenge

This is my first #100DaysOfCode challenge. I have been challenging myself to code for at least an hour a day for 100 consecutive days from November 22, 2023. This repository is created on its 31st day. 

I am joining the challenge with Swift and iOS App development. I am studying to become a developer and following the course [iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/) by Angela Yu who is the best instructor ever! 

In this repository, I will log the progress of my coding journey for 100 days. English is my second language. I will do my best to write this README as clear as it can be. I think the best thing of Angela Yu's course is that I can study both coding and English at once. I love her and of course love coding.

### Day 57 (17 Jan, 2024)
- Lecture 421 - 428, User Interface Design, Section 33 The Complete App Design
   - We should be a tour guide that takes the user on a wonderful journey through the app.
   - The app should be guided, curated and a visual journey for users to go on.
   - Function comes before form.
   - Design is meant to give the user conscious and subconscious clues as to how you should be able to interact with the digital world.
   - Start with the design that is completely monochrome just black and white or hints of gray and Give it a single shot of color to highlight the key things that you want to draw user's attention to.
   - The reason why we want to learn about design in order to better understand, translate and mimic the idea of clients.

<br>

### Day 56 (16 Jan, 2024)
- Started my project "My Word Book" which will be a personal dictionary app and added it to this 100DaysOfCodeChallenge repository
- Created a tableView with a navigation bar and a right bar button
- Added an UIAlert with two text fields and two action buttons
- Error I met today <br>
   `Text fields can only be added to an alert controller of style UIAlertControllerStyleAlert` which means the text fields cannot be added to the actionSheet but to the alert only.

- Lecture 283 - 284, Section 20. In-App Purchases and Apple StoreKit 
   - Table view data source and delegate methods
      - Display some text from an array into a table view
      ```swift
      //An array of items
      var array = [one, two, three, four]

      
      //Table View Data Source Methods 1 - Number of the rows
      override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
         return array.count 
      }
      
      //Table View Data Source Methods 2 - Configuration of the cell
      override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
          let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "IdentifierName", for: indexPath)
          cell.textLabel?.text = array[indexPath.row]
          return cell
      ```
        
      
      - Detect user interactions
      ```swift
      //Table View Delegate Method - What happens user clicks the cell
      override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
         //Print the text of the selected cell
         print(array[indexPath.row])
      }
      ```
   - Location of the "Buy" button(clickable cell, link, or anything)
      - Should be placed where it makes sence and easy to be found
      - In this module, in order to view more quotes user should make a purchase. <br> 
      -> The button is located right below the last free quote. <br>
      -> Make a new UIButton(X) Make one additional cell at the bottom of the table and use it as the big purchasing button(O)

<br>

### Day 33 (Dec 24, 2023) 
**Implement the functionality of cell deletion by using a third party library** <br>
1. Go to [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) > Search "swipe" > Select "[SwipeCellKit](https://cocoapods.org/pods/SwipeCellKit)" <br>
or Go to [SwipeCellKit](https://github.com/SwipeCellKit/SwipeCellKit) on GitHub
2. [Install](https://github.com/SwipeCellKit/SwipeCellKit/blob/develop/README.md#installation)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Terminal,
  ```
  $ pod init
  $ open Podfile -a Xcode
  ```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Podfile,
```
$ pod 'SwipeCellKit'
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in Terminal,
```
$ pod install
```
3. Add `import SwipeCellKit`
4. Set the `delegate` property on `SwipeTableViewCell`
   ```swift
   override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
    let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "Cell") as! SwipeTableViewCell
    cell.delegate = self
    return cell
   }
   ```
5. Adopt the `SwipeTableViewCellDelegate` protocol -> Create an extension to modularise and split up the functionality
   ```swift
   extension ViewController: SwipeTableViewCellDelegate {
   }
   ```
6. Add the delegate methods
   ```swift
   func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, editActionsForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath, for orientation: SwipeActionsOrientation) -> [SwipeAction]? {
    guard orientation == .right else { return nil }
     //orientation of the swipe is from the right

    let deleteAction = SwipeAction(style: .destructive, title: "Delete") { action, indexPath in
     // "title" means the text underneath the icon
     // inside this closure, handle action by updating model with deletion
    }

    deleteAction.image = UIImage(named: "delete")
     // customise the action appearance
   
    return [deleteAction]
   }
   ```
7. Find the image of "delete(trash)" and Drag it into my Assets.xcassets folder <br>
   SwipeCellKit > Example > MailExample > Assets.xcassets > Trash.imageset > [Trash Icon.png](https://github.com/SwipeCellKit/SwipeCellKit/blob/develop/Example/MailExample/Assets.xcassets/Trash.imageset/Trash%20Icon.png) <br>
   *Note: Rename the image with no space in-bewteen the two words. Place the image in 2x position*
8. Add action
   ```swift
   func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, editActionsForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath, for orientation: SwipeActionsOrientation) -> [SwipeAction]? {
    guard orientation == .right else { return nil }
   
    let deleteAction = SwipeAction(style: .destructive, title: "Delete") { action, indexPath in
     // handle action by updating model with deletion
     print("Deleted")
    }

    deleteAction.image = UIImage(named: "delete")
     // match the name with the image name

    return [deleteAction]
   }
   ```
